# Application Guide
The main interface for this project will be a desktop application, although it's still a work in
progress. Soon this will be packaged into more convenient platform-specific builds, but for now it
must be installed and launched from the command line.

To launch, run:
```
python -m naturtag.app.app
```

## Image Selection and Tagging
The **Photos** tab is the main interface for selecting and tagging images:

1. Select images:
    * Drag & drop images or folders into the window
    * Or, select files via the file browser (from the toolbar, or `Ctrl+O`)
2. Select iNaturalist metadata:
    * Enter an iNaturalist observation ID or taxon ID
    * Or paste an iNaturalist URLs with `Ctrl+V`
    * Or search for a species from the **Species** tab (see details below)
    * Coming soon: search for observations from the **Observations** tab
3. Click the **Run** (▶️) button in the top right (or `Ctrl+R`) to tag the selected images

Mouse actions:
* **Left-click** an image for a fullscreen view
* **Middle-click** an image to remove it
* **Right-click** an image for a context menu with more actions:

## Species Search
The **Species** tab contains tools to search and browse species to tag your images with:

### Basic Search
You can start by searching by name, with autocompletion:

### Full Search
Or you can also run a full search using additional filters:
* **Categories** filters by iconic taxa (Birds, Amphibians, etc.). `Ctrl-click` to select multiple.
* **Rank** filters by taxonomic rank (Family, Genus, Species, etc.).
    * Select an exact rank, for example to search only for species
    * Or select a minimum and/or maximum rank, for example to search for anything between a species
        and a family.
* **Parent** uses the selected taxon as a filter, and searches within children of that taxon.

For example, a search for flies (_Diptera_) with 'ornate' in the name will look like this:

### Navigation
* After selecting a taxon, you will see a list of its **Ancestors** and **Children**
* The **Back** and **Forward** buttons (or `Alt-Left`/`Right`) navigate through recently viewed taxa
* The **Parent** button (or `Alt-Up`) selects the immediate parent
* **View on iNaturalist** will show more details about the taxon on inaturalist.org
* Click on a taxon photo (or the thumbnails to the right) for a fullscreen view

### Species Lists
The additional tabs next to search results contain:
* **Recent:** Recently viewed taxa
* **Frequent:** Most frequently viewed taxa
* **Observed:** Taxa observed by you, sorted by observation count

```

### Image Directories
Under the **File** menu, there are submenus with shortcuts to commonly used image directories:
* **Open Recent** Will show the most recently used directories
* **Open Favorites** Will show the directories you have marked as favorites

#### Adding and removing favorites
To add a directory to favorites select **Add a favorite** from the favorites submenu. You can also Ctrl-click a directory from the recent submenu.
