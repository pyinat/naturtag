# History

## 0.8.0 (Unreleased)
**UI:**
* Add tab for basic observation details
* When an observation is selected, show a summary of basic observation details on main screen
* Display observation count and leaf taxon count on taxon info cards
* In refresh mode, check for taxonomy changes and update tags with the new taxon (1:1 changes only)
* Add support for alternate XMP sidecar path format, if it already exists (`basename.ext.xmp` instead of `basename.xmp`)
* Add support for displaying and searching common names in any language supported by iNaturalist.org
    * Uses the `locale` setting from settings menu
    * The packaged taxon DB only contains english names, but a full version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pyinat/naturtag/releases/download/untagged-e757223556c30fa118ba/taxonomy_full.tar.gz)

**CLI:**
* Split CLI into subcommands:
  * `tag`: Main tagging features
  * `refresh`: Refresh tags for previously tagged images
  * `install`: install shell completion + taxonomy database
* Add 3 verbosity levels (`nt -v[vv]`)
* Update `nt tag -p` to accept directories and glob patterns
* Add support for alternate XMP sidecar path format, if it already exists
* Support selecting a sidecar file directly (instead of via an associated image file)
* Support selecting any file type with an associated sidecar (e.g., for RAW image files)
  * Works with individual paths or glob patterns, but not for directories

**Database:**
* Include data for most commonly observed taxa with PyInstaller packages and platform-specific installers
* Pre-compute ancestor IDs, child IDs, iconic taxon, observation count, and leaf taxon count based
  on RG observations from GBIF export
